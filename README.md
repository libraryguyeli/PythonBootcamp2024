# GCPL Python Bootcamp 2024

Hello, and welcome to our first ever Python Bootcamp! We are thrilled to have you with us as we work through the foundations of Python together.

You will have assignments to complete each week, and you will be required to complete those and commit it to your dedicated GitHub repository due each Tuesday night.

Your final project is due the Sunday before your final project will be showcased (Wednesday, October 23rd), so that the instructors have time to look over it and offer any suggestions before you show it off to your fellow bootcampers.

### About billing (should you go over 120 hours in a month):
120 hours per month is roughly 4 hours per day for a 30-day month. We do not recommend you paying for anything in this bootcamp. If you hit your coding limit, reach out to your instructors immediately so that we can find a workaround. You can check your usage and see how close you are to maximum monthly usage by visiting your GitHub settings > Billing and Plans > Billing and Summary > "usage this month" link.
